## Pointer:

* Pointers always contain the address of any other variable.
* Pointers are derived data types.
  
```
datatType * pointerName;
EX:
int* p; (or) int *p; (or) int * p;
all the above are same in c language.
```
```
01: int p; //here p will contain int type value
02: int* p; //here p will contain the address of any other int type variable;
```
