  # Collection Framework

  ## Array:
  
  * An array is index based based homogeneous data elements of fixed size.
  * All arrays are objects in java.
  * The main advantage of array is, we can represent multiple valuse by using a single variable, so that readability will be improved.
  * The main disadvantage is array is fixed in size, so we cannot increase or decrease based on our runtime requirement.

### Limitations of object type arrays:

* Arrays are not growable in nature.
* By using arrays we can represent only homogeneous data elements. we cannot represent heterogeneous data elements.
* Arrays are not implemented by using data structure. Hence for every requirement programmer only need to write the logic. so complexity will be increased.

**To overcome these limitations, we got to a concept called "Collections".**

* Collections are auto growable in nature.
* By using collections, we represent homogeneous and heterogeneous data elements.
* Collections are internally implemented by data structures, so we can expect ready made support.
* If we wants to represent a group of individual objects as a single onject, we got ot a concept called "Collection object".


## Collections:

* If we wants to represent a group of individual objects as a single onject, we got ot a concept called "Collection object".
* Collections interfacs acts as a parent for all collection classe.

  ### Important methods:
     * add(Object obj)
